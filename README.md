# Project2
In this project, we have analyized data from Australian Bureau of Statistics, https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/price-indexes-and-inflation/residential-property-price-indexes-eight-capital-cities/latest-release#data-download

# Data Preparation
Data was gathered from the ABS. Simple formatting of headers and removal of unneeded rows was done to allow the for easier consumption of the data.


# Flask
We used flask to allow the webpage to dynamically update the data live on the same page as directed by the userâ€™s choice of the dropdown.


# Webpage presentation
The Webpage has a dropdown menu which allows the user to choose one of the states in Australia. When a state is chosen the visuals update to the chosen drop down menu. We utilized Plotly to present the historical data of the chosen state. We also added a leaflet map to visually show the geographical location of the chosen state.
